## Experiment Objectives :

* Filtering the false signals and spikes based on Geometric approach.
* Finding an Optimum Geometric pattern. (Rule based - Non-ML)

**Approach**

* Find the angle of cross over between the flip ( flat angle considered as consolidation)
* Find the slope of bar which is responsible for the Cross, the steepness filter cuts out most pattern responsible for failure.
* Comparing the height of sslUp and sslDown the bar on cross and previous (added logic to filter out based on the difference of height)

**Setup**

* SSL period is set to 3, (which is more responsive and generates more signals)

**Initial Observation**

* Tested against all major pairs, without any additional setup, the accuracy is 45%

**Aim of the Experiment**

* To improve the accuracy to 75+%
* To Find one or two pattern (geometrical), less prone to failures, and not impact the accuracy.

**Result**
